# CSE 151A Project - Detecting Alzheimer's via MRI Images Using CNNs and QCNNs 

This project aims to develop a multiclass classifier that predicts the presence and stage of Alzheimer's disease using MRI images. Utilizing a comprehensive dataset of approximately 5,000 images categorized into Mild Demented, Moderate Demented, Non Demented, and Very Mild Demented, we will create a traditional CNN multi-class classifier and, if time permits, a quantum-based (QCNN) classifier to compare accuracy and training speed. Additionally, we plan to develop an intuitive user interface using Streamlit to facilitate easy interaction with the model, enhancing accessibility and usability for potential users.

## Dataset

[Link to Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tourist55/alzheimers-dataset-4-class-of-images/data)

The Alzheimer’s MRI Image Dataset contains approximately 6400 MRI images, divided into training and testing sets. These images are categorized into four classes: Mild Demented, Moderate Demented, Non Demented, and Very Mild Demented. The dataset is designed to aid in developing highly accurate models for predicting the stages of Alzheimer’s disease. The primary inspiration behind this dataset is to support advancements in deep learning for Alzheimer’s stage prediction.
